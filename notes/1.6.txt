Improvement: work with exclusion instead of only inclusion.
Excluding or lowering relevance of results that include words like 'social' or 'german language' etc.
Adding teaching is something I wouldn't have done in a google search and therefore this is the point I would argue 
more suffisticated technics should be used.

Why can we not simply set the query to be the entire information need description?
With the simple search algoeithm (intersect) at hand this would be a very bad strategy, 
since the absence of any tiny word (about, on, a) could disqualify a good result. 
E.g. including "educartion" excludes the obviously most relevant result mathematics.f
